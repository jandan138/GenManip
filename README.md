# GenManip Suite

**GenManip** is a comprehensive robotics simulation suite built on **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, designed for research in **general robotic manipulation**.
It provides an integrated platform for **data generation, benchmarking, and baseline development**, offering a unified workflow from precision scene design to large-scale dataset creation.

This repository contains installation instructions, tutorials, documentation, example benchmarks, and references for all baseline methods.

## 📦 About GenManip

GenManip supports the full workflow—from **handcrafted scenes** to **procedurally generated large-scale datasets**.
Its streamlined toolchain allows you to easily build, customize, and share your own manipulation tasks.

The core concept is the **GenManip Package**:
Install official or community benchmarks just like adding expansion packs to a game.
Everything communicates through a black-box unified API so you can focus on model development without worrying about internal implementations.

GenManip strictly follows **LeRobot GR00t** data conventions, ensuring compatibility with modern training pipelines.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

* 🔌 **GenManip Package System**

  Install or publish benchmark assets with a single command — expandable like game DLCs.

* 📊 **Unified Benchmark Interface**

  Includes *GenManip Scaling Pick-and-Place*, *GenManip IROS Benchmark*, and more.
  All benchmarks share one unified communication API, making model evaluation plug-and-play.

* 🧩 **User-Friendly Docs & Config Templates**

  Rich tutorials and configuration examples help you get started in minutes.
  You can create your own benchmark or data pipeline with just a few config edits.

* 🎨 **Full-Stack Domain Randomization**

  Randomize *objects, layouts, lights, cameras, textures, rooms*, enabling robust large-scale data generation.

* 🤖 **Cross-Embodiment Support**

  Works out of the box with:

  * Franka Panda + Panda Hand
  * Franka + Robotiq 2F-85
  * Aloha Split
  * Lift2

* 📐 **Rule/Execution Set System**

  Provides a structured syntax for defining task completion logic
  (*top / left / right / front / back / in* relations + logical composition). Compute the rules and generate data by execution set, result in photorealistic manipulation data.

* 🚀 **Massive Parallel Execution**

  Run thousands of Isaac Sim instances across multiple servers.
  Stress-tested to **1500 concurrent instances** on **500× RTX 4090 (48GB)** GPUs.

* 🏭 **High-Performance Data Generation Pipeline**

  Built on **cuRobo** + generalized oracle rules.
  Scales from single GPU to hundreds of GPUs.

* 🧱 **Meta Object System**

  Flexible scene composition and object substitution for scalable dataset/benchmark creation.
